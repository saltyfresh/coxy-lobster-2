<p>Welcome to Cozy Lobsters Bed and Breakfast, where the beds are comfy and the breakfasts abundant; in a neighborhood that's quiet, yet close enough to all the big attractions.  
We are located at 2150 Morning Street (close to Congress and Turner Streets). Our phone number is 603 123 4567.
We invite you to come and stay with us. We'll prepare you a breakfast meal that'll get you ready for a day of hiking, fishing or just taking in the sites. And when you come and go during the day, we'll always have some baked snacks or fruits, for some extra energy in our dining room, along with gourmet teas, coffee, juice and purified water.
And when your day's over you can come back and kick off your shoes and relax. Our rooms have  full baths with tub and/or shower; and you can lounge in our spa-quality robes. Then prop yourself up with our oversize pillows to watch television, or read from our wide variety of books and magazines. And of course there's also free WiFi.</p></div></div>

<p>If you are wondering about our name Cozy Lobsters, well it's because lobsters like to live in small crevices and burrows; cozy little spots. And they usually live 45 to 50 years in the wild. Wikipedia says "Research suggests that lobsters may not slow down, weaken or lose fertility with age." So we offer a cozy place to vacation at and hope to keep serving you a long time. Hopefully 40-5o years with the same vigor and love as when we first opened our doors in 2005.</p>
  
<p>We are located at 2150 Morning Street (close to Congress and Turner Streets).</p>
<p>Our phone number is 603 123 4567.</p>
