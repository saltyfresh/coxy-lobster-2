Git and commandline notes  
Ian Sudderth to you (Bcc)show details
Important
For all these commands, anything in brackets is something you replace with some other piece of information, i.e. :
 cd [directory name] 
Means to type cd followed by the name of the director you want to move into
command line cheat-sheet
ls 	shows content of current directory

cd [directory name] 	moves into the directory name

cd .. 	moves into the parent directory

mkdir [directory name]	creates a new directory in the current location

touch [file name]		creates a file in the current directory, remember to include     					extension (.html, .css, etc..)

clear		Clears the window of text


Git cheat-sheet
git init	creates a git repository in the current directory.  You only need to do this once 	   		and do it in the root folder of your project

git add .  or  git add --all	adds all the files for creating a commit

git commit -m “[note about commit]”		creates a commit

git status 	shows the status of the git repository included files that changed or that are 	    		staged for commit

git branch 	shows branches

git branch [branch name]	creates a new branch, copying current branch

git checkout [branch name]	moves to new branch

git merge [branch name]		merges changes from the given branch into the current 						branch

git push	pushes all changes into the github repository
Getting Started
Open up the cloud9 workspace with your project
Navigate to the project folder using

 cd [directory name]

If your project isn’t in a folder, and just in the base workspace folder, skip this step
Create a new repository with

 git init

Add in files for the initial commit with 

git add --all

Make the initial commit with 

git commit -m “[note about commit]”

Sign into github and create a new repository
Copy and paste the code under “..or push an existing project” into the terminal and press enter.
It will ask for username and password, enter them and press enter
Your repository is now ready for work and connected to github!!

Making a Commit
Add all the files you’ve changed with: 

git add .   or    git add --all

Create the commit with a comment about the changes that were made with:		                        

git commit -m “[your comment here]”

Push your files to github with:

	git push

Making a new Branch
Make sure you’re in the branch you want to use as your starting point (usually master)

	git checkout [branch_name]

Create a new branch
	
    git branch [branch_name]

Move to the new branch
	
git checkout [branch_name]
Merging a branch
Move to the branch you want the changes merged into, imagine that merging will pull the changes into the current branch:

	git checkout [branch_name]

Merge the target branch’s changes into the current branch
	
git merge [target_branch_name]

Create a commit and push to github
	
       git add --all
	git commit -m “[comment]”
	git push
Hosting on Github Pages
Once you’re ready to post to Github Pages, merge all your changes into the master branch and move there.
	
git checkout master

Create a new branch named gh-pages and move there
	
git branch gh-pages
      git checkout gh-pages

Create a commit and push to github
	
git add --all
      git commit -m “[comment]”
      git push

Origin / Upstream errors
Occasionally, you will run into problems when you try to push your changes to github, it will say an error involving “upstream” or “origin”, the way to fix that is:

	git push origin [current_branch_name]

This tells github to use the “origin”, which is github’s nickname for your repository inside git, and which branch to use.

Lynda video (free with library card) that walks through git and github basics, highly recommended!!!
